## Introduction

With the rise of coronavirus, most businesses, schools, and government offices have temporarily closed down their physical spaces. Schools have gone virtual, businesses are offering employees the option to work remotely, and many services have pivoted to allow customers to shop and learn via their apps and websites online. Public schools in particular have been hit the hardest by the cornavirus with many to date still meeting virtually.

In the absence of a physical school environment, many have turned to online applications and websites to supplement or replace their previous learning systems. Online educational resources have been in existence for several years, and since its inception there has been considerable growth in the use of these apps. According to BusinessInsider, the global market for kids educational apps in 2017 included 388 million people, and it is predicted that by 2022 it will reach 972 million.

This project was inspired by the percieved increase in the use of technology and in particular apps during the 2020 Coronavirus pandemic. In March of 2020, much of the world was placed on lockdown in order to help deal with the spread of the virus. All in person activities now needed to be replaced with a virtual solution if possible. Among the most affected industries was education. Schools were faced with the unique problem of having to simulate classroom teaching from the comfort of the students homes, while maintaing a level of instruction to still prepare them for the next grade level.

Educational and video conferencing apps have played a major role in facilitaing this shift from classroom to virtual. Within this study we will look at various apects of trends in Google Play Store and Apple App Store during this unique period in time. We will also take a detailed look at trends within apps that fall into the education category and study app performance in the height of the pandemic.
